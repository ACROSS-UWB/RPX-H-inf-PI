This outcome is linked to the research objective RO 1.4 Algorithms for industrial control and has been supported by the Roboprox project (CZ.02.01.01/00/22_008/0004590).

A software tool has been developed for PI controller design for an LTI SISO system. The tool supports an arbitrary number of design requirements in the form of H-infinity specifications, including the H-infinity norm of weighted sensitivity functions and the H-infinity norm of sums of squared magnitudes. The tool also supports closed-loop pole
placement specifications, such as sigma-stability and damping of oscillatory modes. The design method is based on the analytical computation of the boundary of the solution region in the controller parameter plane.
